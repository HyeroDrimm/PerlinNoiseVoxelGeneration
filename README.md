# PerlinNoiseVoxelGenration
 Simple voxel structure generator made using 3d perlin noise and Unity3D. It's nothing fancy, no greedy meshing no optimalization other than not rendering invisible faces. Its just a test to see how proceduraly generated voxel model could be programed.
## Running
Prefed version of Unity is 2020.1.17f1. After opening the project, hit "Play" than you can change setting in "VoxelEngine" and than hit space key and see the changes. You have to move in scene window becouse I didn't implemented camera movement in game. Hope you like it!
